# About Me
I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at IOA, advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zhTW&user=PWBq4TUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">Feiran Yang</a> and Prof. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280194600" target="_blank">Jun Yang.</a><br/>
My research focuses on **microphone array processing**, **(semi-)blind speech separation**, and **acoustic echo cancellation**. I am also interested in **speech enhancement**, **dereverberation**, and **deep learning**.<br/>
**I’m open to cooperation on related topics. Feel free to drop me an email.**

# 🧑‍🎨 EXAMPLES OF PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION

- **Adaptive Echo Cancellation with Fast Convergence Rate and robustness to double-talk**, [2021.06-2022.03]
  - *core-participant*, independently developed and tested different (stereo-)AEC algorithms.

-  **Robust spatial filtering techniques for sound recording**, [2022.02-2023.03]
   - *core-participant*, independently developed a robust spatial filtering algorithm for sound recording with three microphones. The developed algorithm can be utilized to suppress multiple nonstationary (including the competing speakers) signals with little target signal distortion.
